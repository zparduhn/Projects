  <h3>How We Did It</h3>
  <p>
    Mytrex’s systematic approach to designing PERS is unique; Mytrex utilizes its vast
experience and knowledge gleaned from designing not only PERS, but also the
monitoring software and hardware that is used to monitor PERS. Furthermore, Mytrex’s
main business function is to design and manufacture PERS. As a result, those who
purchase the MXD can rest assured that the product has been designed with their best
interest in mind.
  </p>
  <h3>THE MXD: Your answer to telephone service compatibility</h3>
  <p>
      The MXD is the first traditional
      PERS on the market to be
      completely VoIP compatible. When
      a customer switches from POTS
      to VoIP, the MXD simply makes
      the call when needed. As more
      people get rid of their POTS lines
      and switch to the other mediums
      of communication, the MXD will
      continue to become more and
      more valuable to PERS dealers.
