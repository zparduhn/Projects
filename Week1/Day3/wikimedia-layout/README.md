=========

“You have a job interview with Wikimedia, and you’ve been tasked with re-creating their product page shown here: http://www.wikimedia.org/. Instead of using tables for layout, your interviewer has challenged you to use only HTML/CSS with divs to accomplish your task.”

- No inline styles!
- No HTML attributes like “align”
- Use assets from wikimedia.org page
